# Overview  
This project is a learning exercise focused on frontend development, featuring a simple game called **"Guess the Number."**  

## How it Works  
- At the start of the game, a random number between 1 and 20 is generated.  
- Players have **20 attempts** to guess the correct number.  
- After each guess, the game provides feedback:  
  - Whether the guess is too low or too high.  
- If the guess is correct:  
  - The player earns a score equal to the **remaining attempts.**  
  - A lower number of attempts results in a **higher score.**  
- The game keeps track of the **highest score** achieved.
